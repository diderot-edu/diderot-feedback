Dear Diderot User,

Please use this repository to create issues that you observe on diderot (bugs, unexpected or unintuitive behavior, etc).  More generally, you feel free to send us feedback, negative or positive, all greatly appreciated.

Please remember that this is a small project running on volunteer effort and small external grants.  Given that it is being used reasonably broadly at Carnegie Mellon, especially in the School of Computer Science, you might think that it is funded internally, possibly through tuition, but that is not the case.

External supporters of Diderot include NSF, Amazon Web Services, and JP Morgan Chase.  We (I, Umut Acar, and hopefully others using Diderot) are grateful for their generosity!

Thank you!!
