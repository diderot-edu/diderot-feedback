Dear Diderot User,

Please use this repository to create issues that you observe on diderot (bugs, unexpected or unintuitive behavior, etc).  More generally, feel free to send us feedback, negative or positive, all greatly appreciated.  

Note that this is a small project running on volunteer effort and small external grants.  Given that it is being used reasonably broadly at Carnegie Mellon, especially in the School of Computer Science, you might think that it is funded internally but that is not the case.  To be clear, Diderot project has no full time staff, no undergrad or grad student, no faculty, who is internally funded to develop or support Diderot.  Diderot does not run on CMU computers or servers.  

External supporters of Diderot include NSF, Amazon Web Services, and JP Morgan Chase.  We (I, Umut Acar, and hopefully others using Diderot) are grateful for their generosity!

Thank you!!
